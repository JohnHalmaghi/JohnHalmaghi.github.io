This is a basic website I made for my wife when she began her career as an elementary schoo teacher. This is the first published website I ever made (using github pages and the domain melissahalmaghi.com), through making it I learned the bsics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, andbootstrap. I still periodically update it as necissary.
